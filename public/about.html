  I am a Junior at Western Governors University, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My passion for technology and software engineering drives my dedication to programming and developing robust software systems. I enjoy exploring various programming languages and technologies, always eager to learn and apply new skills. Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a strong interest in customer assistance, aiming to leverage technology to enhance user experiences. Additionally, I am deeply interested in philosophy, particularly in the areas of ethics and logic, which provide a valuable framework for my problem-solving approach and professional conduct. Combining my technical expertise with my philosophical interests, I strive to create ethical, logical, and user-centric software solutions.
